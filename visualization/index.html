        In this visualization task, I would analysis three topics about the hot energies: the first one is to show the
        coal consumption over the world; the second one is that showing the wind consumption of each country;
        The last one is to show the solar consumption of each country.
        In this task, it would use two dataset to finish the visualization task, the first one is a vector data
        which is used to draw the world map, the data source link is:
        <p><a href="https://www.trafforddatalab.io/interactive_graphics_companion/data/countries.geojson"
                class="link">https://www.trafforddatalab.io/interactive_graphics_companion/data/countries.geojson</a>
        </p>
        and the other one is the detail energy data set of different countries from 1990 to 2020 year, the data source
        link is bellowing:
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption/download?datasetVersionNumber=1"
                class="link">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption/download?datasetVersionNumber=1</a>

            From the choropleth world map above, it could find the color depth of each country is different. I use the
            coal consumption to represent the color's depth,
            the darker the color, the more coal consumption of this country. We could find that the consumption of coal
            is gradually reducing from the 1990 to 2020 year
            when we pull the year range slide, which has proved that each country is reducing the consumption of coal
            because of the pollution, of course, most energy consumption
            still come from coal in China. Howver, we could know the renewable energy is the trend, Every country is
            exploring in this direction.

    <div class="charts">
        <div id="wind-consumption-map" class="chart"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pane" style="background-color: teal; opacity: 0.8;">
        In this section, I explore the development of the wind energy. From the map above, we could know that USA is the
        most advanced country in the wind energy region. With the rapid
        development of the techniques, more and more countries are paying the attention on the wind energy, especially
        the USA, China and some countries in Europe.

        <div id="solar-multiple-line-charts" class="chart"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pane">
        In all renewable energies, solar energy is also a hot energy which is a pure natural renewable energy, it can
        help each country save money to the greatest extent. From the multiple line
        charts, we could find that more and more countries are using solar energy to produce electricity in recent
        years. I think this energy would play an important role in the development of all
        the countries in the future.
